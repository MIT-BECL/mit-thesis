%% By default, the thesis will be copyrighted to MIT.  If you need to copyright
%% the thesis to yourself, just specify the `vi' documentclass option.  If for
%% some reason you want to exactly specify the copyright notice text, you can
%% use the \copyrightnoticetext command.

% If there is more than one supervisor, use the \supervisor command
% once for each.

% This is the department committee chairman, not the thesis committee
% chairman.  You should replace this with your Department's Committee

% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.  The dotted
% lines for the signatures are made with the \signature command.
\maketitle

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
% \end{abstractpage} commands.

Many people contributed to my PhD, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item my advisor Eric Alm, whom I thanks for for his mentorship,
    unswerving advocacy, and delightful collegiality,
    \item my thesis committee members Paul Blainey and Martin Polz,
    \item my scientific mentors Pierre Wiltzius, Sophia Gershman, Daniel Aalberts, 
        Dieter Bingemann, Sarah Bolton, Ward Lopes, Paul Selvin, and David Wales,
    \item my collaborators and mentors inside the Alm Lab, especially Sarah Preheim,
        Ilana Brito, Thomas Gurry, Sarah Spencer, and Su Vora,
    \item my outside collaborators, especially Terry Hazen and his group,
    \item Doug Lauffenburger and Forest White for making Biological Engineering a
        great community to live and work in,
    \item my colleagues and friends in the Alm Lab,
    \item my colleagues and friends at MIT, especially the 2012 class of
        Biological Engineering graduate students, Jaime Goldstein, and the founding class
        of Writing Lab Fellows,
    \item my parents Mary and Neil and my brother Andrew.
\end{itemize}
My PhD was also aided by funding from Williams College's Dr. Herchel Smith
Fellowship, MIT's Presidential Fellowship, the National Science Foundation's
Graduate Research Fellowship, BP, and the Department of Energy.
